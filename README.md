<h1>Notes  :</h1>
<p>Marlin firmware based on <a href="https://github.com/MrMagounet">MrMagounet</a>'s work on the Sindwinder X2 and adapted for the Genius Pro with TouchMi : <a href="https://www.lesimprimantes3d.fr/forum/topic/44697-tuto-comment-flasher-le-firmware-des-x2-genius-pro-hornet/">[Tuto] Comment Flasher le Firmware des X2 / Genius Pro / Hornet</a></p>

<h2>List of optimizations and additions by MrMagounet to the Marlin 2.1.2 firmware compared to the original Artillery one.</h2>
<ul><li>
		Upgrade to Marlin 2.1.2 (After the upgrade the DFU mode should be able to be activated without opening the printer, if you had an X2 that required it)
	</li>
	<li>
		Support of the M593 Input Shapping function for the X and Y axis, this function allows to calibrate the resonance and to suppress the ghosting effect on the prints, procedure available, <a href="https://www.lesimprimantes3d.fr/forum/topic/51713-calibration-input-shaping-avec-marlin-212/" rel="">procedure available here</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		Baud rate for Flash in DFU mode changed to 250,000 instead of 115,200 (to keep some logic between non DFU and DFU mode).
	</li>
	<li>
		Adjustments to the values for safety and prevention of thermal incidents.
	</li>
	<li>
		Adjustments to the feedrates (X / Y / Z / E) of the X2.
	</li>
	<li>
		Adjustments to the accelerations (mainly the retraction acceleration which was excessive).
	</li>
	<li>
		Replacement of the "Junction Deviation" & "S-Curve" functions by the "Classic Jerk" (Junction Deviation and S-Curve are still capricious under Marlin for the moment).
	</li>
	<li>
		Feedrate adjustment of the Z-Prob for more efficient 3DTouch measurement (Probing Fans Off).
	</li>
	<li>
		Activation of the M48 function (Repeatability test of the automatic levelling sensor).
	</li>
	<li>
		Activation of the "Restore Leveling After G28" function (as soon as a G28 is performed the values of the last reading are automatically reloaded), no more need for G29 or M420 S1 after the G28 in the Gcode start .
	</li>
	<li>
		Activation of the G26 Mesh Validation function.
	</li>
	<li>
		ABL Measurement survey in 49 points instead of 25 points (this is just a personal opinion but it brings more precision on the survey and therefore on the first layer).
	</li>
	<li>
		Activation of the "Nozzle Park Feature" and "Advanced Pause Feature" (M600 support and automatic parking of the head in pause).
	</li>
	<li>
		Activation of the "Adaptive Step Smoothing" function (increased resolution of multi-axis movements, especially at certain motor operating frequencies).
	</li>
	<li>
		BabyStepping is taken into account all the time and not only during the movement.
	</li>
	<li>
		Activation of the "Linear Advance" with a "K to 0" value (which allows you to leave it inactive at 0 or to perform a Linear Advance calibration test and adjust its value), the Linear Advance allows you to keep a constant flow of material out of the nozzle during acceleration and deceleration. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3yK0lJ8TWM" rel="external nofollow">Video explanation of the Linear Advance </a> &amp; <a href="https://marlinfw.org/tools/lin_advance/k-factor.html" rel="external nofollow">Tools for generating the calibration Gcode for Linear Advance</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		Adjusting the ARC Welder function with a much higher resolution (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VTUxZ4Fifo&amp;t=1s" rel="external nofollow">Tom's basement video on the Arc Welder topic</a>).
	</li>
	<li>
		Activation of the M486 function for PrusaSlicer & SuperSlicer users (object cancellation)
	</li>
</ul>

Please test this firmware and let us know if it misbehaves in any way. Volunteers are standing by!

## Marlin 2.1

Marlin 2.1 continues to support both 32-bit ARM and 8-bit AVR boards while adding support for up to 9 coordinated axes and to up to 8 extruders.

Download earlier versions of Marlin on the [Releases page](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/releases).

## Example Configurations

Before you can build Marlin for your machine you'll need a configuration for your specific hardware. Upon request, your vendor will be happy to provide you with the complete source code and configurations for your machine, but you'll need to get updated configuration files if you want to install a newer version of Marlin. Fortunately, Marlin users have contributed dozens of tested configurations to get you started. Visit the [MarlinFirmware/Configurations](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Configurations) repository to find the right configuration for your hardware.

## Building Marlin 2.1

To build and upload Marlin you will use one of these tools:

- The free [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) using the [Auto Build Marlin](https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/auto_build_marlin.html) extension.
- The free [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) : See [Building Marlin with Arduino](https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_arduino.html)

Marlin is optimized to build with the **PlatformIO IDE** extension for **Visual Studio Code**. You can still build Marlin with **Arduino IDE**, and we hope to improve the Arduino build experience, but at this time PlatformIO is the better choice.

## Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

Marlin includes an abstraction layer to provide a common API for all the platforms it targets. This allows Marlin code to address the details of motion and user interface tasks at the lowest and highest levels with no system overhead, tying all events directly to the hardware clock.

Every new HAL opens up a world of hardware. At this time we need HALs for RP2040 and the Duet3D family of boards. A HAL that wraps an RTOS is an interesting concept we would can explore. Did you know that Marlin includes a Simulator that can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux? Join the Discord to help move these sub-projects forward!

## 8-Bit AVR Boards

A core tenet of this project is to keep supporting 8-bit AVR boards while also maintaining a single codebase that applies equally to all machines. We want casual hobbyists to benefit from the community's innovations as much as possible just as much as those with fancier machines. Plus, those old AVR-based machines are often the best for your testing and feedback!

## Submitting Patches

Proposed patches should be submitted as a Pull Request against the ([bugfix-2.1.x](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/bugfix-2.1.x)) branch.

- Follow the [Coding Standards](https://marlinfw.org/docs/development/coding_standards.html) to gain points with the maintainers.
- Please submit Feature Requests and Bug Reports to the [Issue Queue](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/issues/new/choose). Support resources are also listed there.
- Whenever you add new features, be sure to add tests to `buildroot/tests` and then run your tests locally, if possible.
  - It's optional: Running all the tests on Windows might take a long time, and they will run anyway on GitHub.
  - If you're running the tests on Linux (or on WSL with the code on a Linux volume) the speed is much faster.
  - You can use `make tests-all-local` or `make tests-single-local TEST_TARGET=...`.
  - If you prefer Docker you can use `make tests-all-local-docker` or `make tests-all-local-docker TEST_TARGET=...`.

## Contributors

Marlin is constantly improving thanks to a huge number of contributors from all over the world bringing their specialties and talents. Huge thanks are due to [all the contributors](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/graphs/contributors) who regularly patch up bugs, help direct traffic, and basically keep Marlin from falling apart. Marlin's continued existence would not be possible without them.

## Administration

Regular users can open and close their own issues, but only the administrators can do project-related things like add labels, merge changes, set milestones, and kick trolls. The current Marlin admin team consists of:

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
